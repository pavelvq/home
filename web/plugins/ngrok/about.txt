This module is used to connect all home servers with this device, 
which, according to the main idea, can be located anywhere. 
The module uses ngrok for port forwarding, which is free, but not the best solution. 
If you have a home server with a static IP, I advise you to use another module 
(which I myself will most likely write in the future, and if not, then you will have to do it)
